about_content: |
  Hello, I'm Android developer Seongrok Cho with a keen interest in design.<br/><br/>
  
  Since my undergraduate years when I developed [Windows games](https://youtu.be/vx7aT_5YpIA) using C#, I have shown a strong passion for design and developed a deep understanding of **UI/UX and design trends**.<br/>
  This interest has continued into app development, where I've gained **proficiency in Android's view system**. I've consistently improved my **UI development skills** by delving into various aspects, such as CustomView utilization, animation and transitions, user touch interactions, and the modularization of common design systems.<br/><br/>
  
  I have also put in continuous efforts to enhance my **programming skills and development capabilities**.<br/>
  During a 6-month internship at an IT company, I gained valuable **experience in app development and deployment**. Subsequently, I have been involved in ongoing project development, elevating my proficiency and comprehension of **cutting-edge technology stacks**, including design patterns, clean architecture, and Jetpack libraries.<br/><br/>
  
  In recent times, I had the opportunity to take on the role of a **technical team leader** in a team project. This involved system design and providing technical support to the team, broadening my perspective on development even further.
